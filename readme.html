This MATLAB code was contributed by A Farokhniaee.<p/>

Usage:<br/>
------<p/>

To generate plots like figures 2 and 3 in the paper type the name of
the program at the matlab command prompt:<p/>
all_synaptic_gains_E123_paper_figure<p/> In less that a minute the
following plots are generated:<p/>

<img src="./images/screenshot1.png" alt="screenshot 1" width="600"><p/>
<img src="./images/screenshot2.png" alt="screenshot 2" width="600"><p/>
<img src="./images/screenshot3.png" alt="screenshot 3" width="600"><p/>
<img src="./images/screenshot4.png" alt="screenshot 4" width="600"><p/>

For images similar to figures 4 and 5 in the paper run the program:<p/>
LIF_neuron_activity_with_synpases<p/>

<img src="./images/screenshot5.png" alt="screenshot 5" width="600"><p/>
<img src="./images/screenshot6.png" alt="screenshot 6" width="600"><p/>
<img src="./images/screenshot7.png" alt="screenshot 7" width="600"><p/>
<img src="./images/screenshot8.png" alt="screenshot 8" width="600"><p/>
